# Ellipsis - A collaborative story writing platform

**Due to database maintanence costs, this repository is no longer maintained**

## Summary 
Ellipsis was developed as a project to allow individuals to write stories with other people. Users can create their accounts and make new stories or add to existing stories. There is a dedicated archive and publish function available to the original creator of the story

## Security
The project makes use of the PHP password hash function to ensure user security and only the hashed passwords are stored in our database. We never have access to the original password string and it is never stored.

### Next Steps
We want to continue to develop and build this platform and have many ideas for the future. Currently we are figuring out a way to make the website break even (considering that we are all college students and databases are expensive!). We also want to incorporate a feature that will allow users to actually print their stories as real one-off books. Stay tuned for future updates!
